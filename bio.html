Information Technology has always been my ambition, passion and dream profession. Therefore, I’ve decided to study Information Technology and wanted to learn how to develop software and hardware to industry standard, and how computers communicate with each other through networks.

                <p>
                  I have a basic knowledge of programing languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS as well as visual basic and PHP.
                  I created a static website using only HTML and CSS web scripting languages for website assignment.
                  I also made a school database system that able to control student registration system which I created using Microsoft
                   Access application and Visual basic programming language for the database assignment.
                   That’s helped me how to create database system with Visual basic programming language.
                   I have also done different subject assignment and project work on the course in groups that has helped me to develop my communication skills and obtained an experience working with different people.
